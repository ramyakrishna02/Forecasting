# Forecasting
Time series forecasting is the process of fitting a model to time-stamped, historical data to predict future values. It is an important machine learning analysis method with various use-cases, such as predicting the electricity consumption from the smart meters that can help the Electricity company plan the network expansion.

In time series forecasting, we fit a model to time-stamped historical data to predict future values. For example, we can predict the demand for a product in the next ten months based on historical data of five years. 

Machine learning forecasting is a process that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions about future events. It can be used to understand audience needs or predict trends.
